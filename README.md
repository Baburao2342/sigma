# SIGMA - Brotherhood Beyond Time 🌌

Welcome to **SIGMA**, a heartfelt website I created to celebrate the unbreakable bond of friendship between a group of legends.

This isn't just a page — it's a tribute. A digital monument to the memories, chaos, late-night calls, inside jokes, and brotherhood that goes *beyond time*.

## 💡 What is SIGMA?

SIGMA is the name of our group — not just a name, but a vibe.  
This site was built as a token of appreciation for the amazing friendships that shaped our lives.

## 🎉 Features

- ✨ Clean and simple design (made with pure HTML/CSS)
- 🖼️ A custom logo representing the SIGMA legacy
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Section for each member 
- 🕶️ Cool dark theme because we’re obviously cool
